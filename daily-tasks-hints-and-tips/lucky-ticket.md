# Lucky ticket

Lucky tickets are a kind of mathematical entertainment. A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of the first 3 digits coincides with the sum of the last 3 digits of the ticket number.
You are supposed to write a program that checks whether the two sums are equal. The code snippet below displays `Lucky` if they do and `Ordinary` otherwise.

Input: a string of 6 digits.

Output: either "Lucky" or "Ordinary" (without quotes).
