Here is your chance to write instructions for a text-to-speech system. Let's focus on reading phone numbers aloud. The input phone number will consist solely of digits. Print the name of each digit on a new line for the system to read them one by one.

Hint

You can store the digit names in a container, e.g. in a list with the names from 0 to 9 digits = ['zero', 'one', 'two', ..., 'nine'], and refer to each digit by index, digits[2] equals to 'two', etc. Mind the type, an index should be an interger, not a string.
